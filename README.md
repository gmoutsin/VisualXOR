# VisualXOR

This is an educational activity about one-time pad encryption. The pdfs needed for the activity are produced in LaTeX and the tex files in the folder latex. All the figures used are in the folder latex/pics and are produced by running the Mathematica script VisualXOR.wls.

The repository does not include any pdf files, they have to be created by you. If you do not have access to Mathematica, then you can find all the necessary figures [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hjqtkjk7f89j4b4/AAB94u1dQAupIGFEHRQuuiHxa?dl=0).

When I find time I will add here a description of the activity and how the script works. For now, you have to compile the pdfs.

The documents are shared under **CC BY-NC-SA** and the script under **GPL3**.
